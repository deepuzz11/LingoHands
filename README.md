# LingoHands - Translating Gestures, Connecting Worlds üåçü§ù

## Introduction
LingoHands is an AI-powered real-time American Sign Language (ASL) detection system designed to bridge communication gaps for the hearing-impaired. It utilizes deep learning and computer vision to recognize ASL signs from images and video feeds, making communication more accessible and inclusive.

## Features
- **ASL Alphabet Recognition**: Identifies 26 ASL alphabet signs along with special gestures (e.g., space, delete, nothing).
- **Deep Learning Model**: Trained using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for high accuracy.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Capable of recognizing signs from live webcam input.
- **Preprocessed Dataset**: Utilizes the ASL Alphabet dataset for training and validation.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from the Kaggle ASL Alphabet dataset, consisting of:
- Training images: 26 classes (A-Z, space, delete, nothing)
- Test images for model evaluation
- Images are resized to 64x64 pixels for efficient training and inference.

## Model Architecture
LingoHands is built using a CNN model with the following layers:
1. **Convolutional Layers**: Extracts key features from images.
2. **MaxPooling Layers**: Reduces spatial dimensions to prevent overfitting.
3. **Fully Connected Layers**: Classifies ASL signs based on extracted features.
4. **Softmax Activation**: Predicts the most likely sign class.

## Training and Results
- The model was trained using **TensorFlow and Keras** with categorical cross-entropy loss.
- Achieved **high accuracy** on the validation dataset.
- Performance metrics include training loss, validation loss, and accuracy plots.

## Real-World Impact
LingoHands can be integrated into various assistive technologies, including:
- **Live ASL translation apps** to facilitate communication between deaf and hearing individuals.
- **Educational tools** for learning and practicing ASL.
- **Smart home assistants** to recognize ASL commands.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deepuzz11/LingoHands.git
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python tensorflow numpy matplotlib
   ```
3. **Train the Model** (if needed)
   ```python
   python train.py
   ```
4. **Run Predictions**
   ```python
   python predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
   ```

## Future Enhancements
- Extend support for full ASL gestures beyond alphabets.
- Improve real-time processing speed.
- Deploy as a web or mobile application.
